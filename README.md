# Shopping List  
**IN PROGRESS**  
Deceptively simple, this shopping list app uses a Flux pattern with useReducer and useCallback hooks to manage state. It also utilizes Suspense and the lazy function to improve performance by only loading components when they are requested and after data has been fetched.  

I will be adding a proper backend to this soon:)
